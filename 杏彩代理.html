# EVE Online Combat Anomaly Bot

This bot uses the probe scanner to find combat anomalies and kills rats using drones and weapon modules.

## Features

+ Automatically detects if another pilot is in an anomaly on arrival and switches to another anomaly if necessary.
+ Filtering for specific anomalies using bot settings.
+ Avoiding dangerous or too-powerful rats using bot settings.
+ Remembers observed properties of anomalies, like other pilots or dangerous rats, to inform the selection of anomalies in the future.

## â€‹Update

We merged the ratting bot into a larger repository with examples and bots for EVE Online.
This repository remains an almost-empty redirect.

The following link is updated frequently updated and automatically redirects to the newest version:

That guide explains how to run the bot and links the current source codes for development and relevant artifacts.
